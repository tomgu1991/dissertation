\title{The title of the English paper}

\textbf{Abstract:} As one of the most widely used techniques in operations
research, \emph{ mathematical programming} is defined as a means of maximizing a
quantity known as \emph{bjective function}, subject to a set of constraints
represented by equations and inequalities. Some known subtopics of mathematical
programming are linear programming, nonlinear programming, multiobjective
programming, goal programming, dynamic programming, and multilevel
programming$^{[1]}$.

It is impossible to cover in a single chapter every concept of mathematical
programming. This chapter introduces only the basic concepts and techniques of
mathematical programming such that readers gain an understanding of them
throughout the book$^{[2,3]}$.


\section{Single-Objective Programming}
The general form of single-objective programming (SOP) is written
as follows,
